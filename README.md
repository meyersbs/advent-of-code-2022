# advent-of-code-2022

## Goal

My goal here is to implement two solutions: good and ugly. The **good** solution will have proper code comments and use classes/functions when necessary; it should pass an intro level software engineering course. The **ugly** solution is intended to have as few lines as possible; readability doesn't matter.

## Guidelines

- Both solutions must be implemented in python.
- Both solutions must use **only** builtin python libraries.
- Both solutions must use at least one argument (the input file).
- Both solutions must take in the same command line arguments.

## Testing

Both solutions will be tested using the `diff.py` script that I wrote, which outputs the following for each solution:

- Number of lines of code
- Number of significant lines of code
- Average runtime of 10 runs
- Average runtime of 100 runs
- Average runtime of 1000 runs

## Results
